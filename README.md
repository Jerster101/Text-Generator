P1: Text Generation

Project 1 for CMPM 147 at UCSC.  Code modification by Jeremy Dahlberg.

Went for a similar fantasy/medieval story, but tried for more of a storytelling perspective than a call to action.

Complexity:
 - the "area" filler either selects from the "biome" or "civilization" fillers.
 - the "civilization" filler has a chance to take from the "biome" filler.
 - the "descriptor" filler can grab two "descriptor" fillers to make one.
 - the "beast" filler will also grab a "color" filler if it lands on dragon.
